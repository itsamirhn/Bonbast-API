# Bonbast-API

![Build & Deploy](https://github.com/itsamirhn/bonbast-api/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

Free & Open Source Exchange Rate API for [Bonbast](https://bonbast.com).

Be aware that this API uses a web crawler to fetch data, so it might be slow or occasionally blocked.

- No Token required.
- No requests limit.

This code is deployed on my own servers and could be taken down at any time. You can also clone it to run on your own server.

Currently it can be accessed at https://bonbast.amirhn.com

See the documentation [here](https://bonbast.amirhn.com/docs).
